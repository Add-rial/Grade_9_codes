1)waves
2)limited number of missiles at some level
3)display score under "game over" when game gets over......................done
4)increase difficulty as levels advance(increase number of enemies)
5)correct the enemy spaceship not moving bug
6)mention the instructions.................................................done
7)tell the user to press "enter" key to start the game after showing the instructions...done but with space bar



The problem is that the value of the list have been clear when the game is over. So I have to make a variable which checks if
the game is over once or not, and if it is, i have to again append the values of the enemy's variable.

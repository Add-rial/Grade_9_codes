# Grade_9_codes
The not so dumb codes i wrote in grade 9

This consists of the games i made in 9th grade during the lockdowns

And don't tell me about how thrash my whiteboard is. Don't question why i made it in pygame(a game engine)

The games are unfinished and buggy but i have discontinued working on these 3 years ago.
